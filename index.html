        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>She was born in the Guangdong province of China in 1775, and her birth name was Shi Xiang Gu. </li>
          <li>The name Ching Shih isn’t her own — it translates to “widow of Ching” in reference to her late husband and commander of the Red Flags before her.</li>
          <li>She became a prostitute who worked in a floating brothel in Canton. </li>
          <li>In 1801, her life changed when she caught the attention of and married the infamous pirate captain Zheng Yi, leader of the notorious Red Flag Fleet.</li>
          <li>With Zheng Yi and Ching Shih side-by-side, the Red Flag Fleet quickly grew from 200 ships to 1700-1800 ships. By the time of Zheng Yi's death in 1807, only 6 years after marrying Ching Shih, the Red Flag Fleet included approximately 50,000 –
            70,000 pirates. </li>
          <li>Zheng Yi’s adoptive son and heir, Cheung Po Tsai, was originally meant to inherit control of the Red Flag Fleet. Cheung Po Tsai, however, was more than just Ching Shih’s stepson–the young fisherman had also been her husband’s lover. Within weeks of Zheng Yi’s death, Ching Shih had taken Cheung Po as her lover as well, eventually solidifying the relationship through marriage. Soon, she managed to maneuver herself back into power, and obtained leadership of the Red Flag Fleet.</li>
          <li>Ching Shih’s fleet took leadership over many coastal villages, sometimes even imposing levies and taxes on the villages. These coastal villages stretched from Macau to Canton. </li>
          <li>Ching Shih was called "The Terror of South China," and she would cruelly punish those who resisted her by nailing their feet to her ship’s deck and beating them. </li>
          <li>An Imperial fleet was assembled to take the Red Flag Fleet down, combining forces with British and Dutch warships, and Ching Shih sailed out to meet them head-on, easily defeating the armies and taking sixty Imperial ships (and a good majority of the surviving soldiers) for her own fleet. </li>
          <li>The Admiral of the Chinese Navy committed suicide rather than face capture by Ching Shih, and after two years of continued defeat at her hands, the Chinese government finally decided to try a different strategy: offering a peace treaty rather than continuing to attack.</li>
          <li>Negotiations between Cheung Po Tsai and official Zhang Bai Ling hit a deadlock, though. The Chinese government wanted the pirates to kneel before them, and there was disagreement as to what would happen with the reserves of loot. </li>
          <li>Ching Shih took matters into her own hands, and walked into Zhang Bai Ling’s office unarmed, accompanied by 17 illiterate women and children. Ching Shih and Zhang Bai Ling concluded negotiations. Ching Shih was permitted to keep all of her loot. </li>
          <li>To settle the kneeling deadlock, Zhang Bai Ling agreed to witness the marriage of Ching Shih and Cheung Po, for which the two had to kneel before Zhang Bai Ling in thanks. </li>
          <li>Ching Shih ended her career as a pirate, and had a son with Cheung Po. When Chang Pao died, Ching Shih returned to Canton and opened her own brothel and gambling house. She remained in Canton until she died in 1844. </li>
          <li>Unlike many in her line of work, Ching Shih did not die a violent death out at sea and instead was able to retire and live out the rest of her life in peace and comfort. Through tough negotiations, Ching Shih was able to walk away with everything she desired, and the amnesty she hoped for.</li>

        <h2 class="title-text text-center">Ching Shih's code of laws</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>Ching Shih was a strict and regimented pirate lord. She focused much on business and military strategy. 
            <li>She  went to great lengths to form an “ad hoc” government under which her pirates were bound to and protected by laws and taxes. </li>
          <li>Any plunder that was seized had to first be presented to the fleet and registered before it could be distributed. Whichever ship captured the loot was entitled to retain 20% of its value, while the remaining 80% was placed into the fleet’s collective fund.</li>
          <li>Ching Shih set forth very strict rules regarding the treatment of captured prisoners – female prisoners in particular. 
          <li>Female captives who were considered to be “ugly” were released, unharmed.</li>
          <li>A pirate who wished to take a beautiful female captive as their wife was free to do so, but they were bound to be faithful and to care for her. </li>
          <li>Unfaithfulness and rape were both offenses for which a pirate would be executed.</li>
          <li>Pirates that raped female captives were put to death.</li>
          <li>If a pirate had consensual sex with a captive, the pirate was beheaded and the woman he was with had cannonballs attached to her legs and was thrown over the side of the boat.</li>
        </ul>
